# Imbalanced-Classes-Image-Classification-using-SMOTE-Algorithm-and-Transfer-Learning-Techniques
The aim is classify 11 different types of fashion apparels. The train set contains 31719 images and the classes are imbalanced. I have used the SMOTE algorithm to handle the imbalanced class problem then I trained one of the state of the art transfer learning models with some tweaks to achieve training accuracy of about 99% and validation accuracy of about 87% after 21 epochs of training. I have written this code for an ongoing kaggle competition so I am refraining myself from sharing the model architecture.
